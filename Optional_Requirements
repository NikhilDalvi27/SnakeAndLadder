Please do these only if youâ€™ve time left. You can write your code such that these could be accommodated without changing your code much.

-The game is played with two dice instead of 1 and so the total dice value could be between 2 to 12 in a single move.
-The board size can be customizable and can be taken as input before other input (snakes, ladders, players).
-In case of more than 2 players, the game continues until only one player is left.
-On getting a 6, you get another turn and on getting 3 consecutive 6s, all the three of those get cancelled.
-On starting the application, the snakes and ladders should be created programmatically without any user input,
 keeping in mind the constraints mentioned in rules.
